# UMPD-Patcher
my self building fork without relying on Uma-patcher. So basically no need to use Shizuku, and can be easily built completely online.

The source is completely safe, as i'm using it daily drive.
Compatible with latest vesion of the honse game. And the game now has full-screen mode in AOSP (i don't know if OneUI or Chinese OEMs also having it or not), which doesn't present in official sources sadly.

# Usage
* Fork this one, or the original ones.

* Go to Actions tab

* Click on **Run workflow**

* Fill in the base apk link, split apk link from [qoopy](https://qoopy.leadrdrk.com/) (id is **6172**). And the version strings in the "version" section also from that site.

* Sit back and relax. Wait for about 3 minutes, than head to the **Releases** page to download the file.

### Or you can just download the file in the **Releases** page of this repo for convenience. If i'm busy at the moment, dont hesitate and do the steps above for self-build.
